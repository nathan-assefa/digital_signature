    Module: signals.py

    - This module defines Django signals to handle user profile creation
      and saving.

    Signals:
    - `create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs)`: Signal
      to create a user profile when a new user is created.
    - `save_user_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs)`: Signal to save the
      user's profile when the user is saved.

    Dependencies:
    - `django.db.models.signals.post_save`: Signal sent after a modelâ€™s
      `save()` method is called.
    - `django.dispatch.receiver`: A decorator for connecting signal handlers.
